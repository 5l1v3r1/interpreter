[interpreter]

This is a basic interpreter written for a programming languages class.  I've avoided tagging this repository as the name in case other students of the class google around and find it :)

It's really basic, but functional enough to get stuff done.  Variables, functions, basic loops, equality, etc. are all here.  It is a turing complete language.

There's some included examples and a makefile and stuff if you want to build and play around with it.
